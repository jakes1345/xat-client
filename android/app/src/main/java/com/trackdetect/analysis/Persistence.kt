/**
 * Tracks how long a device stays with you and — where there is a position fix —
 * whether it actually travelled with you.
 *
 * The distinction is the whole point of this app. "Seen five times over ten
 * minutes" describes a tracker in your bumper and it equally describes a
 * neighbour's Tile through a wall. Only displacement separates them, so with no
 * position source the stronger claim is simply never made.
